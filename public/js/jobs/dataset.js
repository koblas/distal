Even if you're not sure what this compliance stuff is (it does seem esoteric at times) or you suspect it might be extremely boring (this is true for some people), then you still might want to check this out. We think writing software that makes our customers awesome at managing documents and heroes when it comes to being audit-ready at the drop of a hat is fun and challenging. And frankly, we're warming up to all this compliance stuff. There's documents, revision histories, meta-data galore, workflow (state) diagrams, hierarchies, pointers going every-which-way, and even a good use for cryptographic checksums. Managing document compliance looks a lot like a good distributed source code management system when you look at it that way. So, have a closer look. If you're self-driven, love challenges, and enjoy working with others, then we want to hear from you.  Our team is small, the job is daunting, and we need more talent to meet our development roadmap goals. You would be working on and using our core product, the Lucidoc Compliance Management Solution application; a web-based system largely developed in Perl, SQL, HTML, and JavaScript that has been in production use for ten years. Naturally, some of the work involves maintenance and customer support. But our primary efforts go toward adding new features based on customer, business, and market needs. Our management team is dedicated to keeping distractions to a minimum and roadblocks out of the way (although, they occasionally get through as I'm sure you're familiar with). The development team takes responsibility for deciding how things will be implemented within the framework of the development roadmap. We also have a lot of input into our future technical strategies.  We're not just looking for another coder with the technical chops on some list of bullet points. We want someone who embodies The Three Great Virtues Of A Programmer. Someone with the fortitude to bring order to chaos, clarity to over-cleverness, and elegance to clumsy, brute-forced code. Someone fearless yet vindictive when faced with spaghetti code. Someone who demonstrates eternal vigilance against code entropy. Someone who strives to keep up with evolving development standards in web application infrastructure.   Required skills  This list is not necessarily complete but rather intends to give one a concept of the kind of developer we hope to work with. We don't expect anyone to make a \"perfect score\" and prefer that we are all striving for some unattainable perfection. A link to a more detailed job description is provided below.  - Significant knowledge of and expertise in Perl programming for large applications.  - At least 5 years experience developing web-based applications, including working with session data storage, relational databases, caching, and inter-process communication.  - A solid understanding of the \"separation of concerns\" and how it relates to a MVC application.  - Solid experience and competence with Linux/UNIX, Git or similar version control systems, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and XML.  - Understanding of professional software development processes. Including familiarity with the cycles of requirements definition, issue tracking, version control, automated testing, deployment and maintenance and Agile development methods.  - The ability to think and make decisions rapidly based on business criteria, not exclusively on technical priorities. Equally important is the ability to determine and understand the consequences of every change made in the application.  - Clear and articulate communication, both written and spoken.  - Forward thinking mindset and the ability to consider future growth and analyze scalability of existing systems and software, and to apply those insights to current development.  - The ability to quickly understand requirements, documentation and contribute code towards various project deliverables in a timely and professional manner is required.  - Taking initiative beyond minimum expectations to determine long-term successes of the company.  - Provide guidance and mentoring regarding best practices and software industry standards, code design and implementation.  - Perform code reviews.

We love to go to Salumi and Thai Curry Simple, and get the occasional visit by a boston terrier named Kessler.  Drop us an email if you would like to learn more!

Position Summary   We are growing and looking for a multi-talented User Experience Practitioner to join our weird (but oh so fun!) hardworking team of UX peeps.   You will be part of a small team of User Experience Designers, Usability Researchers, Information Architects, and Analytics ninjas. We are a humble group (despite the \"ninjas\" reference) who are committed to defining and building the future of the Zappos.com website.   The User Experience Practitioner will be assisting in all phases of project lifecycles. Their responsibilities will include, but not be limited to, brainstorming sessions to elicit business requirements, gathering and utilizing user research data, creating wireframes, producing finished screens, writing UX specifications, and building prototypes - basically do some of everything we do in UX while honing your UX skillset. Discovering UX passions and specialties will be strongly enforced (aka highly recommended).   More about the crazy, fun, weird and passionate person that is you    You've got a passion for UX and want to jump in. You have a good working knowledge of UX principles and deliverables. You've got the basics down and want to start building your UX chops.     On that note, you don't know everything about UX and you're just fine with that. You're interested in learning and contributing but equally willing to openly share your creative thoughts and opinions.    You are excited by the idea of working in a small and weird team known for their off-base humor and on-target mission to make User Experience a company mindset. Being collaborative is one of your strongest qualities because you thrive in dynamic team environments.    You know that being part of an innovative culture means rapid and constantly shifting priorities. This excites you to no end.    You celebrate failure. Your path to UX has hopefully shown you that failure is critical to innovation and you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your successes.    You are able to interpret needs, objectives, and direction from multiple sources of input (you speak both \"geek\" and \"marketing-ese\" )    You can communicate ideas and concepts clearly and concisely while quickly applying feedback and direction as needed. You do this by effectively asking the right questions \"with big ears\".    OmniGraffle amazes you, but Adobe Illustrator will always hold a special and dear place in your heart.   The boring but important technical stuff you have    Experience that demonstrates an understanding of and skills related to user experience design, processes and research methods.    Ideally some experience working on e-commerce sites, preferably large-scale, dynamically driven ones.    Experience sketching, defining, and documenting UX design as well as developing interaction requirements/specifications    Familiarity with HTML/DHTML, CSS, javascript and other web technologies and their inherent strengths and limitations as they relate to UX development (you're all about the semantic web!)

Why join us? In January 2012, Zappos.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries were named #11 on the 2012 Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For List.   Why else? We offer an extensive benefits package for all full-time employees, including medical, dental, vision, and 401k!  And. . . we're hiring like crazy right now, and looking for smart, forward-thinking problem solvers to join our world-class, fairly wacky team.  Oh, and one more thing! Cover letters are cool but do you know what's even cooler?! Show us who you are with a cover letter VIDEO! You will be able to upload one when applying for this position. (Video cover letters are not required but if you wanna do one, we wanna see it!)   Position Summary   We are growing and looking for a talented Senior User Experience Designer to join our weird (but oh so fun!) hardworking team of UX peeps.  The Senior User Experience Designer will be involved in all phases of the development process. Their responsibilities will include, but not be limited to, running brainstorming sessions to elicit business requirements, gathering user research data, creating wireframes, producing finished screens, writing UX specifications, and building prototypes.  You will be part of a small team of User Experience Designers, Usability Researchers, Information Architects, and Analytics ninjas. We are a humble group (despite the \"ninjas\" reference) who are committed to defining and building the future of the Zappos.com website.  The boring but important technical stuff you have     A strong body of work that demonstrates advanced skills in e-commerce user experience design, including examples of the processes and research methods that informed your designs.   Proven experience working on e-commerce sites, preferably large-scale, dynamically driven ones.    Proven experience defining, developing, and documenting UX design and interaction requirements/specifications    Familiarity with HTML/DHTML, CSS, javascript and other web technologies and their inherent strengths and limitations as they relate to UX development (you're all about the semantic web!)   Experience mentoring other passionate UXers.    Experience developing UI and interaction pattern libraries is a huge plus.    Advanced experience creating high fidelity interactive prototypes is such big a plus that it makes us get all twitchy with excitement.   If you want the fun and feel of a start-up company, but the solid management and resources of an established business, this may be the place for you!  More about the crazy, fun, weird and passionate person that is you     You're a master at turning ideas into solid UX deliverables. Whether the initial concepts come to you as a detailed 40 page document or scribbled on the back of a napkin you know what steps to take to turn them into exceptional experiences.     You are more flexible than an Olympic gymnast and able to shift gears faster than this years' Daytona 500 winner. You know that being part of an innovative culture means rapid and constantly shifting priorities. You live for the challenge of it.    Your real-world experience has taught you that \"best practices\" can be a dirty word. You understand usability best practice rules inside and out -- so that you know when it's appropriate to break them. You're interested in blazing new trails and establishing new practices that work specifically for  our unique environment.   You know there's no \"I\" in \"TEAM\" but there is in \"Innovation.\" You have a team oriented, collaborative approach to user experience design.    You're able to communicate ideas and concepts clearly and concisely. You know collaboration is key but design by committee run amok can be the death of a good UX design.     You celebrate failure. You know that failure is critical to innovation and you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your successes.   You are able to interpret needs, objectives, and direction from multiple sources of input (you speak both \"geek\" and \"marketing-ese\" fluently).   You are so into online shopping and ecommerce that you have completely forgotten where your local shopping mall is.   You believe that Jared Spool would easily win a UX celebrity grudge-match with Jakob Nielsen -- figuratively speaking, of course! We don't advocate violence of any kind, but wouldn't that make for an interesting session at next year's Information Architecture Summit?    You are excited by the idea of working in a small and weird team known for their off-base humor and on-target mission to make User Experience a company mindset.

Why join us? In January 2012, Zappos.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries were named #11 on the 2012 Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For List.   Why else? We offer an extensive benefits package for all full-time employees, including medical, dental, vision, and 401k!  And. . . we're hiring like crazy right now, and looking for smart, forward-thinking problem solvers to join our world-class, fairly wacky team.  Oh, and one more thing! Cover letters are cool but do you know what's even cooler?! Show us who you are with a cover letter VIDEO! You will be able to upload one when applying for this position. (Video cover letters are not required but if you wanna do one, we wanna see it!)   Position Summary   We are growing and looking for a multi-talented User Experience Practitioner to join our weird (but oh so fun!) hardworking team of UX peeps.   You will be part of a small team of User Experience Designers, Usability Researchers, Information Architects, and Analytics ninjas. We are a humble group (despite the \"ninjas\" reference) who are committed to defining and building the future of the Zappos.com website.   The User Experience Practitioner will be assisting in all phases of project lifecycles. Their responsibilities will include, but not be limited to, brainstorming sessions to elicit business requirements, gathering and utilizing user research data, creating wireframes, producing finished screens, writing UX specifications, and building prototypes - basically do some of everything we do in UX while honing your UX skillset. Discovering UX passions and specialties will be strongly enforced (aka highly recommended).   More about the crazy, fun, weird and passionate person that is you    You've got a passion for UX and want to jump in. You have a good working knowledge of UX principles and deliverables. You've got the basics down and want to start building your UX chops.     On that note, you don't know everything about UX and you're just fine with that. You're interested in learning and contributing but equally willing to openly share your creative thoughts and opinions.    You are excited by the idea of working in a small and weird team known for their off-base humor and on-target mission to make User Experience a company mindset. Being collaborative is one of your strongest qualities because you thrive in dynamic team environments.    You know that being part of an innovative culture means rapid and constantly shifting priorities. This excites you to no end.    You celebrate failure. Your path to UX has hopefully shown you that failure is critical to innovation and you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your successes.    You are able to interpret needs, objectives, and direction from multiple sources of input (you speak both \"geek\" and \"marketing-ese\" )    You can communicate ideas and concepts clearly and concisely while quickly applying feedback and direction as needed. You do this by effectively asking the right questions \"with big ears\".    OmniGraffle amazes you, but Adobe Illustrator will always hold a special and dear place in your heart.   The boring but important technical stuff you have    Experience that demonstrates an understanding of and skills related to user experience design, processes and research methods.    Ideally some experience working on e-commerce sites, preferably large-scale, dynamically driven ones.    Experience sketching, defining, and documenting UX design as well as developing interaction requirements/specifications    Familiarity with HTML/DHTML, CSS, javascript and other web technologies and their inherent strengths and limitations as they relate to UX development (you're all about the semantic web!)    An interest in data driven design balanced with an empathetic approach.    Experience with UI and interaction pattern libraries is a huge plus.

We value motivation, efficiency, and working smart. We offer competitive salary/benefits and a great opportunity to grow with the company. The future is mobile and if you're interested in contributing to a game-changing product, we want to hear from you. You'll be joining a very experienced team who are pioneering the next generation mobile media exchange. Your creativity and ingenuity will be on the front lines of our offering and will directly impact the success of our business.  Our platform processes approximately 10 billion requests per month and our device Software Development Kits (SDKs) are in the hands of hundreds of mobile app developers; thousands by year end. Quality is absolutely critical to our success. As the Principal Engineer of our Quality Assurance team, you will participate in all phases of the development process and will lead the design, development, execution, and automation of test plans for a diverse set of system components including high volume Java-based server applications, Flex-based user interfaces, and the mobile device SDKs. As the successful candidate for this position, you have a passion for delivering excellence and you sweat the details. You have extensive hands-on experience devising validation strategies that go far deeper than black box testing. Web technologies (e.g., HTTP, XML, JSON), related tools, SQL databases, and scripting (e.g., Python, Bash) are second nature. You are curious, highly analytical, and you understand that doing this job right means understanding not only our systems, but our business.  PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES  As the Principal QA Engineer on our engineering team, you will  1. Provide process and technical leadership in the development of test strategies and plans across a complex (but technically awesome!) portfolio of applications and system components. 2. Bring your innovation, creativity, and track record of expertise to bear advancing our commitment to automation of functional, performance, and stress testing protocols.  3. Participate fully in our Agile/Scrum development process as an integral part of the Nexage Engineering team. 4. Interface with Product Management and Client Services teams to ensure requirements compliance, determine release readiness, and triage defects discovered in the field.  REQUIREMENTS  As a QA engineering professional, you have 8+ years of hands-on experience, much of it doing deep testing of complex systems. You have at least a Bachelor's in Computer Science or a related engineering field and very possibly a Master's Degree, but you also know that keeping your skills sharp is a never-ending educational process. You enjoy tackling problems that are often elusive and working with software engineers to ensure the highest level of quality. You're not content to know \"what\"; you need to know \"why\" and are meticulous in your attention to detail. You have passions equally for technical excellence and seeing your work have an impact. This is partly why you'd prefer a high-visibility role in a fast-paced early stage company versus the alternative. You aspire to great things and are willing to work to get there.  ORGANIZATION  The Principal QA Engineer reports to the CTO / SVP of Engineering and will have significant interaction and visibility throughout Engineering and the company. There are currently two Senior QA Engineers and a primary near-term objective is to scale the team's capacity and capabilities. In addition to Quality Assurance, the Engineering team includes impressive talents in server-side technologies, mobile device software, user interfaces, and IT Operations. We all work together in our Headquarters - currently Waltham MA, but we're planning to move into downtown Boston later this year.  NEXAGE BENEFITS  Nexage prides itself in building exceptional career opportunities and offering outstanding benefits to our team such as PPO and HMO health plan options, tuition reimbursement, and 3 weeks vacation to start. In that regard, Nexage is not your average company. We have the enthusiasm of a start-up, a culture driven from industry veterans committed to long-term growth, and the benefits package of a mature industry leader. We offer great benefits for a very simple reason we can attract the best people and then enable them to focus on the extraordinary opportunity in front of them (without worrying about incomplete or inadequate benefits).

Each of us has been personally frustrated by the one-size-fits-all approach at school at various points in our lives and we're here to rage against this factory model. Our principles are simple students come first, learning has to be fun, and machines should be answering the who/what/when/where/hows of studying.  What we do  Firecracker helps us create a custom learning plan that constantly adapts to our unique goals, learning style and strengths. It's like having your own personal tutor -- 24/7. We're all about making learning personal. We believe that then, and only then, can learning be fun, engaging and effective. Each of us learns in dramatically different ways, but we are all taught the same material in the same way at the same pace. Firecracker's mission is to solve this 7 trillion dollar problem.   (see \"About Firecracker\" below for more)  We're looking for Ruby engineers who want to take their talents to Cambridge and build technology that really helps people. You enjoy a good conversation about theory or architecture, but you are happiest writing code and turning those ideas into usable products. You care about the quality of your code and products more than anyone you know and you're proud to take full ownership of your work. You think about the experience of using your products as you're building them. You care about getting the right solution on the table regardless of whether it was your idea, your teammate's idea, or the foosball table repair man's idea. Ideas that live inside boxes bum you out and ideas that live outside boxes jazz you up. You're not a church mouse when you feel strongly about something but your approach to voicing your opinions doesn't involve Tasers and bull horns. Your teammates' glorious code makes you almost as happy as your own glorious code.  Working at Firecracker  We're building our first barge in the Cambridge area and we need help filling our loft-y space with enough espresso to put a brontosaurus into A-fib. We have a lot of fun doing our job and we get excited about pushing new code live several times a day. We go on semi-annual hackathons to cool places like Nova Scotia (if you didn't know there is a super fast boat that you can put your car on and gamble all the way to Nova Scotia from, now you know). Pizza and beer are never far away, nor are fresh fruit and vegetables for that matter.  We're Looking For   Extensive experience developing with RoR (including Redis/Resque, Memcached, etc.)  Love affair with agile and TDD  Experience with MySQL and relational DB design  Comfortable with AWS (EC2 + S3)  Experience with version control and a staged deployment environment (Git/Github, etc)  Comfortable with RESTful API design and execution (Sinatra)  Comfortable with command-line scripting in a unix environment  Passion for exploring different design patterns  Familiarity with service-oriented architecture  Bonus Points If   You have a machine learning/AI background  You like working with large datasets  You throw up a little if you ever have to use Windows  You know your way around Engine Yard or Heroku or custom-built production environments  Firecracker's get    The immense satisfaction that comes from doing something critical for the advancement of humanity alongside other extraordinarily awesome people  A competitive salary  Stock options   Free catered lunches every day  100% employer-covered health insurance  The most bad-ass business cards that ever lived (or didn't live but you get the idea). No joke.   If you think you're a fit and want to change the world for the better, send us your resume or LinkedIn profile, Github account info, portfolio etc. to welovematz@firecracker.me   About Firecracker  Education is a 7 trillion dollar industry; that's 570 times bigger than the online advertising market and more than the GDP of Italy, France and the UK combined. Given this enormous investment we would expect that our education system does a good job of teaching us. Yet research shows this isn't the case. Why? Because even though each of learns in dramatically different ways, we are all taught the same material in the same way at the same pace.  That's why Firecracker's online learning platform gives us a custom learning plan that constantly adapts to our unique goals, learning style and strengths. It's like having your very own personal tutor -- 24/7. Unlike other adaptive learning solutions, Firecracker is rooted in proven cognitive science techniques such as spaced repetition and retrieval practice that dramatically increase knowledge acquisition, retention, and test scores.

Why join us? In January 2012, Zappos.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries were named #11 on the 2012 Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For List.  Why else? We offer an extensive benefits package for all full-time employees, including medical, dental, vision, and 401k! And. . . we're hiring like crazy right now, and looking for smart, forward-thinking problem solvers to join our world-class, fairly wacky team.  Oh, and one more thing! Cover letters are cool but do you know what's even cooler?! Show us who you are with a cover letter VIDEO! You will be able to upload one when applying for this position. (Video cover letters are not required but if you wanna do one, we wanna see it!)   Position Summary   We are growing and looking for a multi-talented User Experience Practitioner to join our weird (but oh so fun!) hardworking team of UX peeps.   You will be part of a small team of User Experience Designers, Usability Researchers, Information Architects, and Analytics ninjas. We are a humble group (despite the \"ninjas\" reference) who are committed to defining and building the future of the Zappos.com website.   The User Experience Practitioner will be assisting in all phases of project lifecycles. Their responsibilities will include, but not be limited to, brainstorming sessions to elicit business requirements, gathering and utilizing user research data, creating wireframes, producing finished screens, writing UX specifications, and building prototypes - basically do some of everything we do in UX while honing your UX skillset. Discovering UX passions and specialties will be strongly enforced (aka highly recommended).   More about the crazy, fun, weird and passionate person that is you    You've got a passion for UX and want to jump in. You have a good working knowledge of UX principles and deliverables. You've got the basics down and want to start building your UX chops.   On that note, you don't know everything about UX and you're just fine with that. You're interested in learning and contributing but equally willing to openly share your creative thoughts and opinions.  You are excited by the idea of working in a small and weird team known for their off-base humor and on-target mission to make User Experience a company mindset. Being collaborative is one of your strongest qualities because you thrive in dynamic team environments.  You know that being part of an innovative culture means rapid and constantly shifting priorities. This excites you to no end.  You celebrate failure. Your path to UX has hopefully shown you that failure is critical to innovation and you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your successes.  You are able to interpret needs, objectives, and direction from multiple sources of input (you speak both \"geek\" and \"marketing-ese\" )  You can communicate ideas and concepts clearly and concisely while quickly applying feedback and direction as needed. You do this by effectively asking the right questions \"with big ears\".  OmniGraffle amazes you, but Adobe Illustrator will always hold a special and dear place in your heart.   The boring but important technical stuff you have    Experience that demonstrates an understanding of and skills related to user experience design, processes and research methods.  Ideally some experience working on e-commerce sites, preferably large-scale, dynamically driven ones.  Experience sketching, defining, and documenting UX design as well as developing interaction requirements/specifications  Familiarity with HTML/DHTML, CSS, javascript and other web technologies and their inherent strengths and limitations as they relate to UX development (you're all about the semantic web!)  An interest in data driven design balanced with an empathetic approach.  Experience with UI and interaction pattern libraries is a huge plus.  Located in Las Vegas!!!

Each of us has been personally frustrated by the one-size-fits-all approach at school at various points in our lives and we're here to rage against this factory model. Our principles are simple students come first, learning has to be fun, and machines should be answering the who/what/when/where/hows of studying.  What we do  Firecracker helps us create a custom learning plan that constantly adapts to our unique goals, learning style and strengths. It's like having your own personal tutor -- 24/7. We're all about making learning personal. We believe that then, and only then, can learning be fun, engaging and effective. Each of us learns in dramatically different ways, but we are all taught the same material in the same way at the same pace. Firecracker's mission is to solve this 7 trillion dollar problem.   (see \"About Firecracker\" below for more)  We're looking for Ruby engineers who want to take their talents to Cambridge and build technology that really helps people. You enjoy a good conversation about theory or architecture, but you are happiest writing code and turning those ideas into usable products. You care about the quality of your code and products more than anyone you know and you're proud to take full ownership of your work. You think about the experience of using your products as you're building them. You care about getting the right solution on the table regardless of whether it was your idea, your teammate's idea, or the foosball table repair man's idea. Ideas that live inside boxes bum you out and ideas that live outside boxes jazz you up. You're not a church mouse when you feel strongly about something but your approach to voicing your opinions doesn't involve Tasers and bull horns. Your teammates' glorious code makes you almost as happy as your own glorious code.

Given this enormous investment we would expect that our education system does a good job of teaching us. Yet research shows this isn't the case. Why? Because even though each of learns in dramatically different ways, we are all taught the same material in the same way at the same pace.  That's why Firecracker's online learning platform gives us a custom learning plan that constantly adapts to our unique goals, learning style and strengths. It's like having your very own personal tutor -- 24/7. Unlike other adaptive learning solutions, Firecracker is rooted in proven cognitive science techniques such as spaced repetition and retrieval practice that dramatically increase knowledge acquisition, retention, and test scores.

We create digital campaigns and products in the form of sites, mobile apps, videos, social campaigns, and experiential installations.   YOU ARE  A decent human being in search of a good job with a shop that is big enough to bite off important, stable and meaningful work and small enough to still have fun doing it.   YOU HAVE THESE SKILLS - We mostly do PHP and JavaScript. But we're open we keep it lean and get the job done. - Strong experience with a couple of frameworks and CMS's. Like...you've used Wordpress, Drupal, CodeIgnitor, Laravel, SilverStripe, Symfony (or Silex), Magento, etc, etc, you-get-the-point. - You know what CSRF means and can think of 2 good ways to stop it. Security is a part of how you build (basic form protection to hashing sensitive info, to HMAC-SHA1 to oAuth). - You know that the Cerberus of application performance tuning, horizontal scaling, and overall robustness is a double-edged sword of glory and pain, but you like the challenge, and caching is your friend.  - Attention to detail and what makes a good experience a great one. - Understanding of QA/Testing - we distribute our QA workload here, so it's a team effort. You'll be helping all of us build the best product possible.  YOU CAN ACCEPT AND EMBRACE THESE THINGS ABOUT US  Our house rules are simple but not for everyone   - No shitheads allowed.  We have a shithead eco-flush system that targets douchebaggery and assholery at its faintest signals and expunges it from our premises with an all-natural, organic floodwater filtration pump. Upside There are no shitheads here. Downside Downside? Don't be a shithead. . .there is no downside.   - Honesty is paramount.  We get along and we constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients, we don't hide or say what we think others want to hear. We do it with respect and we value truth, transparency and honesty above all else.   - We do it live. We're not reckless or feckless. . .but we believe strongly in getting something in our hands quickly and iterating (as opposed to powerpointing/conceptualizing our way through life). This sometimes means rapid prototyping a proof of concept in the morning, presenting it in the afternoon and nailing it down for a launch by the end of the week.   - We do it together.  Our work is done in a giant fish bowl and we help each other solve problems all day long. If you are more of a \"consolidated strike weapon\" and prefer to move through the jungle alone. . .we're probably not the place you want to hang your hat.   The \"human side\" of this is very important to us (and if you are the right person it will be vital to you as well). But needless to say if you are a) a good person and b) someone who enjoys working within a team and c) someone who gets their shit done and likes accountability as much as visibility for kicking ass - we'd like to see you soon.   THE DETAILS  If you're interested in the position, please write to us knowing the following   - The owner of the company (and the guy writing this post) will read ALL of the applications first and pass on the ones that appear to be a match onto the Technical Director. I will read every application - I always do, you have my word.  - If you are interested in applying, please send a resume (if you have one), some links to your work and whatever notes you want to pass on about each and write me a note that does its best to convey who you are underneath the layers of standard issue cover letter babble and HR bubble wrap. Talk to me like a human being who values directness and using your own words. If you need to use a four-letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I'll take that over what you would think I typically \"need to hear\" in a job application. So have at it....but know that I am really just looking for good, smart people who are in search of the kind of special sauce we make here.   - Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience (and height)* Full-time position with benefits but open to starting with a freelance gig if wading into the water is preferred on both sides.   - Please respond with \"APOLLO CREED\" in the subject line of your response so I know that you read this whole thing and that you are not a nefarious machine, a recruiter or a well-intentioned company that is unwilling to understand I need a human being sitting in my office to do this work I need done (not an off-shore firm).

We create digital campaigns and products in the form of sites, mobile apps, videos, social campaigns, and experiential installations.   YOU ARE  A decent human being in search of a good job with a shop that is big enough to bite off important, stable and meaningful work and small enough to still have fun doing it.   YOU HAVE THESE SKILLS - We mostly do PHP and JavaScript. But we're open we keep it lean and get the job done. - Strong experience with a couple of frameworks and CMS's. Like...you've used Wordpress, Drupal, CodeIgnitor, Laravel, SilverStripe, Symfony (or Silex), Magento, etc, etc, you-get-the-point. - You know what CSRF means and can think of 2 good ways to stop it. Security is a part of how you build (basic form protection to hashing sensitive info, to HMAC-SHA1 to oAuth). - You know that the Cerberus of application performance tuning, horizontal scaling, and overall robustness is a double-edged sword of glory and pain, but you like the challenge, and caching is your friend.  - Attention to detail and what makes a good experience a great one. - Understanding of QA/Testing - we distribute our QA workload here, so it's a team effort. You'll be helping all of us build the best product possible.  YOU CAN ACCEPT AND EMBRACE THESE THINGS ABOUT US  Our house rules are simple but not for everyone   - No shitheads allowed.  We have a shithead eco-flush system that targets douchebaggery and assholery at its faintest signals and expunges it from our premises with an all-natural, organic floodwater filtration pump. Upside There are no shitheads here. Downside Downside? Don't be a shithead. . .there is no downside.   - Honesty is paramount.  We get along and we constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients, we don't hide or say what we think others want to hear. We do it with respect and we value truth, transparency and honesty above all else.   - We do it live. We're not reckless or feckless. . .but we believe strongly in getting something in our hands quickly and iterating (as opposed to powerpointing/conceptualizing our way through life). This sometimes means rapid prototyping a proof of concept in the morning, presenting it in the afternoon and nailing it down for a launch by the end of the week.   - We do it together.  Our work is done in a giant fish bowl and we help each other solve problems all day long. If you are more of a \"consolidated strike weapon\" and prefer to move through the jungle alone. . .we're probably not the place you want to hang your hat.   The \"human side\" of this is very important to us (and if you are the right person it will be vital to you as well). But needless to say if you are a) a good person and b) someone who enjoys working within a team and c) someone who gets their shit done and likes accountability as much as visibility for kicking ass - we'd like to see you soon.   THE DETAILS  If you're interested in the position, please write to us knowing the following   - The owner of the company (and the guy writing this post) will read ALL of the applications first and pass on the ones that appear to be a match onto the Technical Director. I will read every application - I always do, you have my word.  - If you are interested in applying, please send a resume (if you have one), some links to your work and whatever notes you want to pass on about each and write me a note that does its best to convey who you are underneath the layers of standard issue cover letter babble and HR bubble wrap. Talk to me like a human being who values directness and using your own words. If you need to use a four-letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I'll take that over what you would think I typically \"need to hear\" in a job application. So have at it....but know that I am really just looking for good, smart people who are in search of the kind of special sauce we make here.   - Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience (and height)* Full-time position with benefits but open to starting with a freelance gig if wading into the water is preferred on both sides.   - Please respond with \"APOLLO CREED\" in the subject line of your response so I know that you read this whole thing and that you are not a nefarious machine, a recruiter or a well-intentioned company that is unwilling to understand I need a human being sitting in my office to do this work I need done (not an off-shore firm).
